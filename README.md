# Codeforces.NET

### What does it do?
This let's you manipulate data supplied by the [codeforces api](https://codeforces.com/api/help) and using it however you like. A few project suggestions would be **automatic hacks, automatic submissions, filtering problems, looking up problems/users/blogs and eventually we've been discussing using some ML to pick problems based on your data (still discussing if it's doable with the data we have).**

### Status:
So far I have got everything accessible through the api including authorized requests. The wrapper has synchronous/asynchronous methods for everything and objects are supplied with loaders for sub-objects.

### Contribute:
Doesn't matter if it's contributing to the wrapper or if you have a project idea that would need it. Feel free to propse any ideas or mention your project and I will refer to it here.
